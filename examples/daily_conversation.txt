[ALICE] Hey Bob! How was your day at work?
[BOB] It was pretty good, thanks for asking. We had some interesting meetings.
[ALICE] That's nice. Did you have lunch?
[BOB] Yes, I grabbed a sandwich from the cafe. How about you?
[ALICE] I had a salad with grilled chicken. It was really tasty.
[BOB] Sounds healthy! Are you free tonight? I thought we could go to the movies.
[ALICE] That sounds fun! What movie do you want to watch?
[BOB] I was thinking about the new action movie. Have you heard about it?
[ALICE] Yes, I've heard good reviews about it. What time does it start?
[BOB] The evening showing starts at seven o'clock. Should we grab dinner before?
[ALICE] Sure! We could try that new Italian restaurant near the cinema.
[BOB] Perfect! Let's meet at six. We'll have plenty of time for dinner.
[ALICE] Great! I'll see you then. See you soon!
[BOB] See you later! Have a good evening!
